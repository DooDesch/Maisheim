THIS UPLOAD IS NOT FROM AEDENTHORN
I'm just uploading a few mods that I found on Nexus and enjoyed to make it easier for my friends to download and use them, nothing more, please show your appreciation or ask your questions/report bugs to the person who made this mod directly through his Nexus account.

This mod lets you edit various stats for individual armor pieces and has two global armor multipliers as well. It also adds the possibility for new resistance types, and implements a new Water resistance against the Wet status effect.

This mod also fixes a bug in the vanilla game that makes it not recognize frost immunity for environmental cold.
