## About

This mod is a port of the [ValheimTooler](https://github.com/Astropilot/ValheimTooler) on BepInEx.
ValheimTooler is a free and open-source software that allows you to cheat on the Valheim game via a multitude of options offered. Be reasonable some features are particularly game breaker.

Here is the list of features offered by this mod:

* **Player**
  * God Mode, you don't lose any more life
  * Unlimited stamina for you
  * Unlimited stamina for the other players
  * No stamina for the other players
  * Fly Mode, sweet creative mode üïäÔ∏è
  * Ghost Mode, the monsters cannot see you
  * No placement cost
  * Explore all your minimap (Irreversible on the world on which it is activated!)
  * Reset your minimap
  * Teleport to another player (works only if the player is visible on the minimap)
  * Instantly heals a player
  * Instantly heals all players
  * Activate a Guardian Power for you
  * Activate a Guardian Power for all players
  * Raise/Decrease a skill to any level
  * Tame all nearby creatures
  * Unlimited weight for inventory
* **Entities & Items**
  * Spawn any entity
  * Delete all drops on the ground
  * An Item Giver to add any item you want in your inventory
* **Miscellaneous**
  * Inflict damage to a player (ignores the no-pvp mode)
  * Kill all entities except players
  * Kill all players
  * Send a event message to all players (the yellow one on the middle of the screen)
  * Send a chat message as any username
  * A ESP for players, monsters, pickables, deposits and drops

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è**: On each feature that allows you to choose a player, the list will only include players who are at a certain distance from you (quite large but not the whole map for all that). This is not a personal choice but a technical limitation of the game. Until I find a way to get around it (if possible) this behavior will remain.
